      The Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) is a classification 
      of Australia into a hierarchy of statistical areas. First introduced in 2011, 
      the ASGS replaced the Australian Standard Geographical Classification (ASGC) 
      that had been used since 1984. The ASGS is a social geography, developed 
      to reflect the location of people and communities, and used for the release 
      and analysis of statistics and other data. The ASGS is updated every 5 years 
      to account for growth and change in Australia's population, economy and infrastructure.
